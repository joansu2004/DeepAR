In this project I propose to develop a Wholesale Energy Price Estimator based on Machine Learning tools and use it to forecast the day-ahead spot price for Germany, trying to overcome the above mentioned issues derived from the high renewables penetration, namely decline trend of price level as renewable capacity increases over the years (meaning non-stationary behavior) and high volatility (leading to high peaks and the necessity of dense granularity of input data).
